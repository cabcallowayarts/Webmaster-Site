          ABOUT
        </h2>
        <p>
          In many situations <strong>stigma</strong> causes youth to feel unable
          to reach out or ask for help in the first place. Because of the stigma
          surrounding mental illness, people feel there is something wrong with
          them. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Sterotypes</strong> can cause people to be dismissive of youth
          asking for help. The sterotype that teens are moody and emotional can
          cause people to pass of those asking for help, claiming that "everyone
          feels that way". <br />
          <br />
          When mental illnesses are <strong>sensationalized </strong> in media
          portrayals like TV, people take them less seriously. They are seen as
          "tragically beautiful" and sometimes presented as something
          desireable, not debilitating conditions
