        </h2>
            <p>In 2020, five entrepreneurs saw the toll the COVID-19 pandemic was taking on themselves andothers as healthcare access became increasingly limited. They had siblings, cousins, and
            parents who found themselves at a loss as to how to proceed with vital pediatric care. So they set out to create their own solution.
