                During this pandemic, we have seen the immense stress put onto the American healthcare system,
                especially when it comes to pediatric care. As a result, at TeleTots, our goal is to create
                a safe and effective way for kids to get the necessary healthcare.

                <br />
                <br/>

                At Teletots, we have partnered with four healthcare providers to provide efficient telemedicine to any customer.
                We have an app, a destop application, and are planning on so much more to serve any and all
                providers and recipients of pediatric healthcare.
                We have opened an office on Medical Highway in Wilmington Delaware. We will host an opening Zoom
